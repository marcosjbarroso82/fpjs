This is a framework for building web apps through a process of applying controller sequentially to an app model.


## TODO
- [ ] Use a *Factory* to apply common logic to the controllers like "quick return" if the message has been executed or if the prefix of the message is not relevant to the controller.
- [ ] Nested sequence of execution of controllers.
- [ ] Implement a *Timer* to emulate calls from outside the app.
- [ ] Implement a "Control Panel" to send messages from outside the app.
- [ ] Implement the validation of schemas for imputs and outputs of controllers.
